[TITLE]

~ Abstract
In this report, we carried a time series analysis on the AirPassengers dataset. Through a series of analyses and figures, a ARIMA model was built. We also performed a validation of our model.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset AirPassengers consists ofÂ monthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949 to 1960, and can be obtained by `data(AirPassengers)` in R. See Figure 1 for details.

## Trend, Season and Unequal Variance

It is obvious that the time series is not stationary and is seasonal with trend and unequal variance. To show that we can decompose the time series using `stl(AirPassengers)`. The plot of the decomposition is in Figure 2.

```
decomp <- stl(Airpassengers, s.window = "periodic") ##decompose data
plot(decomp) ##Figure 2
```

We can start by remove the seasonal component using `seasadj(decomp)`. The time series after is plotted in Figure 3.

```
AirP <- seasadj(decomp)
plot(AirP)
```

The trend can be dealt with ARIMA, thus we wouldn't pay special attention to it. Unequal variance does not influence much, we ignore it as well.

##Stationary, PACF, ACF 

Evaluating stationary can be done by `adf.test(AirP)`, and the result given by is 
```

	Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

data:  diff(AirP)
Dickey-Fuller = -7.2275, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01
alternative hypothesis: stationary
```
Thus the data is stationary. Details are shown in Figure 4.

We should notice that ACF is not in the expected form due to the trend. To have a better understanding of the data for further model building, we can instead investigate the differenced data `diff(AirP)`. In Figure 5, we show its ACF and PACF.

We see that the suitable ARIMA for for the deseasonal data should be ARIMA(1,1,1) or ARIMA(0,1,1).

#Model building

We can start by `auto.arima` to automatically calculate p and q of the ARIMA model. The basis of the model is as follows:
```
Series: AirP 
ARIMA(0,1,1)                    

Coefficients:
         ma1
      0.2006
s.e.  0.0816

sigma^2 estimated as 280.3:  log likelihood=-605.4
AIC=1214.79   AICc=1214.88   BIC=1220.72

Training set error measures:
                  ME     RMSE      MAE       MPE     MAPE
Training set 1.91357 16.62601 12.47854 0.4630476 5.355115
                  MASE         ACF1
Training set 0.3895854 -0.008861853
```
And the residuals are plotted in Figure 6.

fit<-auto.arima(AirP, seasonal=FALSE)
summary(fit)
tsdisplay(residuals(fit), lag.max=144, main='(0,1,1) Model Residuals')

fit2 = arima(AirP, order=c(1,1,1))
summary(fit2)
tsdisplay(residuals(fit2), lag.max=144, main='(1,1,1) Model Residuals')
