[TITLE]

~ Abstract
In this report, we carried a time series analysis on the AirPassengers dataset. Through a series of analyses and figures, a ARIMA model was built. We also performed a validation of our model.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset AirPassengers consists ofÂ monthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949 to 1960, and can be obtained by `data(AirPassengers)` in R. See Figure 1 for details.

## Trend, Season and Unequal Variance

It is obvious that the time series is not stationary and is seasonal with trend and unequal variance. To show that we can decompose the time series using `stl(AirPassengers)`. The plot of the decomposition is in Figure 2.
